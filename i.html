        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. As global temperatures rise, ecosystems are disrupted, weather patterns become more extreme, and both humans and wildlife face new challenges. This essay will explore the causes and effects of climate change and discuss potential solutions to mitigate its impact.</p>

        <h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>
        <p>The primary driver of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to a gradual warming of the Earth's surface. Human activities, such as <strong>burning fossil fuels</strong> for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes, contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

        <h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Climate change has far-reaching effects on both the environment and society. Some of the most notable impacts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rising sea levels, which threaten coastal communities</li>
            <li>More frequent and severe weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires</li>
            <li>Loss of biodiversity, as some species struggle to adapt to changing conditions</li>
            <li>Health risks due to increased heat and the spread of diseases</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solutions to Address Climate Change</h2>
        <p>To combat climate change, we need a combination of individual and collective actions. Some effective strategies include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Reducing carbon emissions by transitioning to <em>renewable energy</em> sources like solar and wind.</li>
            <li>Protecting and restoring forests, which act as natural carbon sinks.</li>
            <li>Improving energy efficiency in homes, industries, and transportation.</li>
            <li>Encouraging sustainable practices, such as recycling and reducing waste.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Climate change is a global crisis that requires immediate action. By understanding its causes and effects, we can take meaningful steps to reduce our environmental impact. Through collective efforts at all levels of society, we have the potential to create a sustainable future for generations to come.</p>
