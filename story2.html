    <h1>The Lost Coin</h1>
    
    <p>On a quiet afternoon, <strong>Sara</strong> was walking through the park when something shiny caught her eye. She bent down and saw a <em>small, golden coin</em> half-buried in the dirt.</p>

    <p>"Where did this come from?" she wondered, picking it up. The coin had an inscription: <q>"Find me at the old bridge."</q></p>

    <p>Sara's heart raced. She had heard rumors about the old bridge at the edge of town, but no one had ever dared to go there. Feeling both excited and nervous, she decided to follow the message.</p>

    <h2>The Bridge</h2>
    <p>As the sun began to set, Sara reached the old bridge. It was crumbling and covered in vines, but in the fading light, she could see a faint glow beneath it.</p>

    <p>She knelt down and saw a box hidden in the shadows. <em>Her hands trembled</em> as she opened it, revealing a treasure beyond her wildest dreams.</p>

    <h2>The End</h2>
    <p>What had started as a simple walk in the park had turned into an adventure that would change Sara's life forever.</p>
