    <h1>The Impact of Urbanization on the Environment</h1>
    <p>Urbanization is a complex process that transforms rural landscapes into urban areas. This rapid expansion of cities has profound effects on the environment, which are both positive and negative.</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>With more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas, the effects of urbanization on the environment have become a crucial topic of discussion. While urbanization drives economic growth and development, it also poses significant environmental challenges.</p>
    
    <h2>Positive Effects</h2>
    <p>Urbanization can lead to improved <strong>infrastructure</strong> and access to <span style="color:green;">green spaces</span>. It fosters innovation and efficiency in public services, transportation, and energy consumption.</p>

    <h2>Negative Effects</h2>
    <p>The environmental drawbacks of urbanization include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Increased industrial activities and vehicle emissions contribute to air quality degradation.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Urban runoff and inadequate waste management contaminate water bodies.</li>
        <li><strong>Habitat Destruction:</strong> Expansion of urban areas leads to the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Urban areas contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating global warming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
    <p>To mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization, several strategies can be implemented:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Promoting sustainable urban planning and development.</li>
        <li>Investing in renewable energy sources and green technologies.</li>
        <li>Enhancing public transportation and reducing reliance on private vehicles.</li>
        <li>Implementing effective waste management and recycling programs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Urbanization is an inevitable part of modern development, but it is essential to address its environmental impacts. By adopting sustainable practices, we can ensure that urban growth contributes positively to both the economy and the environment.</p>
