        <h2>Challenges in Education</h2>
        <p>Despite the significant benefits of education, many challenges persist. In some parts of the world, access to quality education remains limited due to factors such as poverty, political instability, and inadequate infrastructure. These challenges prevent millions of children from receiving the education they deserve, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.</p>
        <p>Another challenge lies in ensuring that education remains relevant in a rapidly changing world. As technology advances and the demands of the job market evolve, educational systems must adapt to equip students with the skills needed for the future.</p>
