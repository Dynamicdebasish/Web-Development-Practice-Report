<h1>The Lost Key</h1>

<p>In a small village by the sea, there lived a <strong>young boy</strong> named Tom. One afternoon, while playing near the cliffs, he found an <em>old, rusty key</em> buried in the sand.</p>

<p>Curious, Tom rushed home to show his grandmother. She gasped, recognizing the key immediately.</p>

<blockquote>"This is the key to the <strong>forgotten lighthouse</strong>," she said. "No one has opened its doors in over <em>a hundred years</em>."</blockquote>

<p>With excitement in his heart, Tom knew what he had to do. The next morning, he set out toward the lighthouse, determined to unlock its secrets.</p>
